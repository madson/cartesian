Cartesian API
=============

Create an API server in [go](https://golang.org/). It will deal with a series of points represented as (x,y) coordinates on a simple 2-dimensional plane. Take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system if you need a refresher on this concept.

It must have an api route at `/api/points` that accepts a `GET` request with the following parameters, and returns a JSON list of points that are within `distance` from `x,y`, using the Manhattan distance method. The points should be returned in order of increasing distance from the search origin.
- `x` integer (required). This represents the `x` coordinate of the search origin.
- `y` integer (required). This represents the `y` coordinate of the search origin.
- `distance` integer (required). This represents the Manhattan distance; points within `distance` from `x` and `y` are returned, points outside are filtered out.

The Manhattan distance is measured "block-wise", as the distance in blocks between any two points in the plane (e.g. 2 blocks down and 3 blocks over for a total of 5 blocks). It is defined as the sum of the horizontal and vertical distances between points on a grid. Formally, where `p1 = (x1, y1)` and `p2 = (x2, y2)`, `distance(p1,p2) = |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|`.

On startup, the API server should read a list of points from `data/points.json`.

How to run
==========

On terminal run the following command lines:

```sh
cd /path/to/cartesian/project
go run . --port 8000
```

How to test
===========

Here's an example using HTTPie:

```sh
http -v "http://localhost:8000/api/points?x=1&y=1&distance=24"
```
